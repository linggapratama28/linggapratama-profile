# <p align=center> Hi, I'm Lingga <img src='https://github.com/elhakimyasya/elhakimyasya/blob/master/assets/Hi.gif' width='29' height='29'/>
I graduated from the Broadcasting major, but since January 2021, I have been pursuing knowledge in the field of data. My experience working as a data user began as a Junior Data Engineer at Mahdian Group from March to April 2022. Additionally, I took courses at DataCamp from January 2022 to January 2023, where I learned the following skills and career tracks:
1. Career Track: Data Analyst in SQL
2. Career Track: Data Analysis with Python
3. Skill Track: Power BI Fundamentals
4. Skill Track: Fundamental Spreadsheets
5. Skill Track: Importing & Cleaning Data with Python
6. Part of the Data Engineer track (not completed). 

The skills that I have acquired while working and studying as a Junior Data Engineer and Data Analyst are:
1. Programming Languages (Python 3, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. Data Processing (Pandas, Numpy, Microsoft Excel, Spreadsheets)
3. Data Visualization (Power BI, Google Data Studio, Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
4. Web Scraping (FB Ads, REST API get/request, Google Cloud API)
5. Data Pipeline (Apache Airflow)
6. Machine Learning (Scikit Learn: Linear Regression, L1/L2/Elastic net regression)
With my foundational knowledge in data, I am eager to take on new challenges and grow in data analytics. Please feel free to contact me at:
